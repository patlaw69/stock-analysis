 We did this by refactoring the code to be able to expand the results.  It appears these companies are results have declined from 2017 to 2018.  While expanding this data did provide more information, it did take longer to get results.

##Summary
###In summary, it is easy to see that the advantage of refactoring code will help save you time in creating code.  This can also work against you in the time it takes to get this information from that code you created.  At this time I don not see a con against using refactored code except for the time it take for the date to run.  It is a benefit in preventing you from wasting time in writing thing over and over.  I feel the the benefit might out weigh the time used in refactoring code.
